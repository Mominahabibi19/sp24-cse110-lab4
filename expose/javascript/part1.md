2. What is printed by line 13?  Line 13 will print `final result:  20`
3. What is printed by line 9?   Line 9 will print `values added:  20`
4. What is printed by line 13?  The code returns a referenceError: result is not defined. We get this error because the `result` variable is declared within the `if` block which means it can only be accessed within that block. Outside of the `if` block `result` is not accessible. Therefore, attempting to access `result` on line 13 will result in a Reference Error becasue `result` is not defined in that scope.
5. What is printed by line 9? The code returns a TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. we get this error because we are reassign a new value to a constant `result`. On line 7 we reassign `result` with new value `num1 + num2`. Therefore attempting to assign a new value to `result` will result in a TypeError. 
6. What is printed by line 13? Line 13 will give an error as well because the error occurs before line 13 is reached, it won't execute. The error happen on line 7 when we reassign `result` with new value `num1 + num2`. Therefore, line 13 will not reached and the code will not print anything beyond the error message.
